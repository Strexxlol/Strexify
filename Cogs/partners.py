                With Sharded having one main task, to be the one bot every server needs
                **How?** By creating all the commands that are mainly used in many servers, and *combine them into one bot.*

                You can check out all features in our server.
                We also offer coding help (focused on Discord bots, written with the **discord.py** / **nextcord.py** library)
                You can also find tutorials on how to start a Discord bot yourself!
                *Not interested in coding?* We also offer a chill launch and if you have a question, related to anything, we'll help!\n\n- Interested? Join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/BVGB3yXS3z)""",
